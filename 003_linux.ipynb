    "The first thing to know about `vi` is that it is highly optimized for *performing editing actions* and not necessarily for *text entry*. The idea is that users will far wish to do things like cut, paste, delete characters or words, or move around documents just as often as they want to actually type out characters. Normally, the action of moving up several paragraphs, copying and pasting a word, and moving back to the bottom may take considerably longer than typing. This time debt is optimized away with an extensive list of single-character shortcuts."
